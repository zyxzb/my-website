          I have experience in telecommunications and e-commerce, but I realized
          that I am more interested in writing code. In addition to coding, I
          enjoy photography, keeping up with new technologies, biking, and
          listening to electronic music. If you're looking for a reliable and
          enthusiastic Frontend/React developer to work with, let's team up and
          create something amazing.
